# Daily Internship Report  [2024/02/26] Day 1

## Overview
Today, I focused on widgets.Stateless widgets anf statefull widgets.Stateless widgets are immutable where as stateful widgets are mutable that is the data oe we can say paremeter passed in stateless widgets is unchange and static same as statefull widgets are dynamic and it can change its state according to need. Despite encountering a few challenges, I managed to make significant progress.

## Learnings
Today, I learned:
- Stateless widgets are such type of widgets which is basically immutable that means it cannot change its properties after implementation.It is light weight in compare to stateful widget.it is basically use in such time in which we need static Ui format such as logo of the company,text, icons etc.In short stateless widgets are static,immutable and light weight.The example of stateless widgets are Text,Row,listview,container,image,etc
- Stateful widgets are such types of widgets which is listed as mutuable which generally means that can change its properties over time and as well as maintain state.Such widgets (Statefull widgets) are geneerally use in such time when the ui need to be dynamic menas it should get change according to its need.Its is more complex in compare to the statefull widgets.The example of statefull widgets are animated container,TextField, Radio Box, snackbar, datepicker is also one,time picker and many more.
- They both play their one vital role in development phase and use according to their need.
- There are enormous types of widgets listed in the pub.dev with its documentation.lets talk some about them:

 1. Container
 - Container are basiclly use as a space and provide us many properties such as decoration,child,height,width,padding, margin etc

 2. Text
 - Text are generally use to display a string in Ui and serve us many different properties such as style,data etc.

 3. Column
 - Column are basically use for vertical alignement of the widgets listing inside the childern.

 4. Row
 - Row are use to horizontally alignement of widgets inside the childens.

 Their are many other types of widget in list.
 

## Goals for Tomorrow
For tomorrow, my goals are:
- Testing a app.
- learn more breif about widgets and its properties.
